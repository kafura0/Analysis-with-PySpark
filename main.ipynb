    "**Spark **is a `distributed computing framework` that runs on a cluster of machines. The cluster is managed by a driver program that runs on a master node. The driver program is responsible for distributing the work to the worker nodes and collecting the results from them. The driver program is also responsible for storing the data in the cluster. The data is stored in a data structure called RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset). RDD is a collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel. RDDs are immutable, which means that once they are created, they cannot be changed. The only way to change an RDD is to create a new RDD from an existing one. RDDs are fault-tolerant, which means that if a node in the cluster fails, the data on that node can be reconstructed from the other nodes. RDDs are also lazy, which means that they are not evaluated until an action is performed on them. This allows Spark to optimize the execution of the RDDs.\n",

It also keeps track of the cluster state: which nodes are alive, which are dead, which are running which tasks, etc. The Spark Context is created by the driver program and is used to create RDDs.\n",
